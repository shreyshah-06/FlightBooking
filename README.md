# Flight Booking Website

## Aim of this Project
### My major focus of this project has been backend development. The UI/UX and the frontend of the site can be improved with a bit more of time easily.

## Scope of the project
* This Project has been made in a short time so the functionalities are limited for now, they can be increased in future easily.
* The UI/UX is minimal as the project has been made keeping in mind the backend as the primary goal. This can also be improved easily in future.
* With some work on the project it can be deployed to a wider audience.
* The code is well commented and formatted so tweaks and additions could be easily made.

## Backend
### For this project I have made a custom Backend using NodeJS,ExpressJS and MongoDB. Using the backend the data is getting fetched and manipulated accordingly.
### Several endpoints have been made in backend for the various functionalities.This functionalities can be increased or the existing ones can be changed very easily as the code has been well commented and formatted.

## Frontend
### ReactJS has been used for the frontend development along with MUI and Bootstrap.The frontend can be made a lot better with some more time.

## Technologies Used

* ReactJS
* MaterialUI
* BootStrap
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* MongoDB
* JWT Authentication


## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
